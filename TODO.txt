________________________________________________________________________

		~~ HIGH PRIORITY
			~ Room stuff
				~ CreateRoom, ExitRoom
				~ GameUserList, GameProcess
				~ (Clock, Update, Score, QuickJoin)
				~ All these PMCodes
			~ Complete userlist
		~~ /HIGH PRIORITY
		
		~ Common stuff - don't know what it's about yet
		~ Game Statistics

		~~ ANTICHEAT
			Known as WatchdogTask

			~ Use taskplanner to create event with highest privileges (require administrator)
			~ Run task immediately (SYSTEM)
			~ Delete task
			~ Task will take care of WarRock.exe (pid exchange over udp locally)
			~ Task will take care of itself by bluescreening (bad farewell) if it's closed down abnormally

			NOTICE: There's a nice source code example in Cineplex project
		~~ /ANTICHEAT

		~ Fix game launcher
		~ Go on with aCI (antiCheatIntegration [don't know what aCI was for, took it from NTA cuz' sounds cool], communicates with watchdogTask)
		~ (Add IRC chat?)
